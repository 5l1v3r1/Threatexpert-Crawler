Uses google search API to find URLs that match specific criteria. Limited to 100 searches a day for the free version Hence theorotically only 300000 results can be obtained in a day.


Usage: testing_threatexpert.py [options] [url]
options: 
                crawl = Start Crawling
                db = re-run from table api_results_cache
                url = scrape the url specified in [url]


Use threatexpert_schema.sql to generate schema for a database for storing results. There is a built in functionality to re crawl the pages once the google api results are cached. crawling can also be done on a per URL basis
